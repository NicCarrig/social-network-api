# Challenge 18 NoSQL - Social Network API

## Description
The back end API for a social netork site. Users can create, update, and delete profiles, as well as share thoughts and react to thoughts that other users have shared. Users can also add and remove other users as friends.

## Requirements
This project requires access to a MongoDB database to function, as well as Node and Express.js

## How To Use
To run this API locally, after MongoDB is setup and the repo is cloned, simply run this command from the CLI:
```bash
npm i
```
Once the packages are installed then run:
```bash
npm start
```
The server should then be running on the localhost and can be tested in Insomnia or similar programs.
